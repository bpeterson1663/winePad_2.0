# winePad 2.0

During my time at Prime Digital Academy, I created a wine database management system called winePad for my final solo-project. After graduating Prime, I wanted to keep learning new things so I started learning PHP and wanted to redo that project using PHP. 
This project now includes angular instead of jQuery as the client side language and will still utilize PHP and MySQL
